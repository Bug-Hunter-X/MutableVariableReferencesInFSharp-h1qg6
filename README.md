# F# Mutable Variable and Reference Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with mutable variables and references in F#.  The `bug.fs` file contains code that showcases how changing a mutable variable's value affects its reference.  The `bugSolution.fs` file provides a potential solution, illustrating best practices to avoid such issues.

**Issue:** Incorrect use of mutable variables can lead to unexpected behavior and make code harder to reason about.
